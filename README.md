# Phase 1 Project- Zero Hunger.
**Author: Joel Nyongesa**

# Project Introduction.
One child dies of hunger every ten seconds worldwide. 3.2 million children die of hunger every year in the Sub-Saharan Africa region alone. The second SDG, according to the UN, is ensuring Zero Hunger worldwide by 2030. The Zero Hunger Project aims to eradicate this crisis, addressing the urgent issue of global hunger and malnutrition. Through offering donations and prompting millions of people worldwide to offer donations regarding the same, I envision a future where no child or individual suffers from the devastating consequences of hunger, aligning with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of achieving Zero Hunger by 2030.


# Solution.
This project aims to tackle this by highlighting the regions most affected by hunger in Kenya, and promt users to make donations towards providing food to these vulnerable children. The live site is deployed [here](https://joelnyongesa.github.io/Phase-1-Project/)
